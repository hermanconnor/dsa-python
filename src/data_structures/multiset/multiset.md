# Multiset (Bag)

A **Multiset** (also known as a **Bag**) is an **unordered collection of items** where **duplicate items are allowed**.

## Key Characteristics

- **Unordered:** The items are not stored in any particular sequence (unlike a List or Array). The order in which items are added or retrieved is generally not important.
- **Duplicates Allowed:** You can add the same item multiple times. This is the main difference between a Bag and a Set (where all elements must be unique).
- **Focus on Presence and Frequency:** The main things you care about are which items are in the Bag and **how many times** each item appears.
