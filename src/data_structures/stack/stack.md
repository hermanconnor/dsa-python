# Stack

A **Stack** is a **linear data structure** that follows the principle of **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** — the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

You can think of it like a stack of plates:

* You **add (push)** plates on top.
* You **remove (pop)** plates from the top.
* You can only see or interact with the **top** plate at any time.
