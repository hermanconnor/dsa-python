# Stack

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** principle. Think of it like a stack of plates or books. The last plate you put on top is the first one you can take off.

Here's a breakdown of the key characteristics:

- **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out):** The element inserted most recently is the first one to be removed.
- **Linear Data Structure:** Elements are arranged in a sequential order.
- **Single Point of Access:** Operations (insertion and deletion) are typically performed at only one end, called the **top** of the stack.
