# Data Structures & Algorithms in Python

A comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in Python, built for my learning purposes.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pytest**

## 📚 Data Structures

- [x] Array / Dynamic Array
- [x] Multiset (Bag)
- [x] Stack
- [x] Queue
- [x] Queue (Circular)
- [x] Queue (Two Stacks)
- [x] Linked List (Singly)
- [x] Linked List (Doubly)
- [x] Deque
- [x] Deque (Circular)
- [x] Graph (Directed Adjacency List)
- [ ] Graph (Undirected Adjacency List)

## 🎯 My Learning Goals

- Master fundamental data structures and their operations
- Understand time and space complexity analysis
- Practice implementing algorithms from scratch
- Build problem-solving skills for technical interviews

## 📝 Notes

This repository is a work in progress as I continue learning and implementing new data structures and algorithms. Each implementation prioritizes clarity and educational value over performance optimization.
