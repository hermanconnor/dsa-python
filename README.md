# Data Structures & Algorithms in Python

A comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in Python, built for my learning purposes.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pytest**

## 📚 Data Structures

- [x] Dynamic Array
- [x] Multiset(Bag)
- [x] Stack
- [x] Queue / (Circular) / (Two Stacks)
- [x] Linked List (Singly) / (Doubly)
- [x] Deque / (Circular)
- [x] Graph (Directed Adjacency List) / (Undirected Adjacency List)
- [x] Graph (Directed Adjacency Matrix) / (Undirected Adjacency Matrix)
- [x] Tree (Binary Search Tree)
- [x] Heap (Min Heap) / (Max Heap)
- [x] Priority Queue
- [x] Hashtable (Hashmap) / (Hashset)
- [ ] Union-Find(Disjoint Set)

## 🎯 My Learning Goals

- Master fundamental data structures and their operations
- Understand time and space complexity analysis
- Practice implementing algorithms from scratch
- Build problem-solving skills for technical interviews

## 📝 Notes

This repository is a work in progress as I continue learning and implementing new data structures and algorithms. Each implementation prioritizes clarity and educational value over performance optimization.
